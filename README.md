The OpenStudio Measure Tester is a rubygem that exposes rake tasks for testing OpenStudio measures.

## Installation

* Add the following code to the Gemfile and Rakefile of a measure repo you desire to test.

    * Gemfile
        ```ruby
        source 'https://rubygems.org'
        gem 'openstudio_measure_tester'
        
        # or for release on Github
        gem 'openstudio_measure_tester', github: 'NREL/openstudio_measure_tester_gem', branch: 'develop'
        
        # or for local development
        gem 'openstudio_measure_tester', path: '../<path-to-checkout>'
        ```
    
    * Rakefile
    
        ```ruby
        require 'openstudio_measure_tester/rake_task'
        OpenStudioMeasureTester::RakeTask.new
        ```
    
* Run `bundle update`
* run `bundle exec rake -T` to see the new tests that are available.
* In existing measure directory, run `bundle exec rake openstudio:all`
