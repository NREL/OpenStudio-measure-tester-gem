**MEASURE APPLICABILITY**
0 = Success
**INITIAL CONDITION**
The initial building had 2 space shading surfaces.
**FINAL CONDITION**
The final building has 3 space shading surfaces. Initial capital costs associated with the improvements are $0.
**INFO MESSAGES**
Removed all 2 space shading surface groups from the model.
Added overhang Object of type 'OS:ShadingSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 3 - Overhang' to Object of type 'OS:SubSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 3' with projection factor 0.5 and offset 0.
Added overhang Object of type 'OS:ShadingSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 5 - Overhang' to Object of type 'OS:SubSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 5' with projection factor 0.5 and offset 0.
Added overhang Object of type 'OS:ShadingSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 1 - Overhang' to Object of type 'OS:SubSurface' and named 'Sub Surface 1' with projection factor 0.5 and offset 0.
